## Hi, I'm Mohammed Elhaj

🔍 I'm currently diving deep into data analysis using Power BI, Excel, Python, and SQL to turn raw data into actionable insights.

📊 I enjoy uncovering trends, automating reports, and building dashboards that help teams make smarter decisions.

🚀 I'm actively seeking a role in data analysis or business intelligence, ideally in a collaborative environment where I can contribute from day one and grow quickly.
