## Hi, I'm Mohammed Elhaj

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a budget planner with Python and Django.

I'm on the look out for a role in backend web development, ideally in Python. I'd especially love to work at a startup on a tight knit team where I can make an impact quickly. If you're hiring, let's chat!
